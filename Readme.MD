**Machine_Learning_CHD**

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of males developing **coronary heart disease (CHD)** within the next 10 years.
We will explore the proportion of patients at significant risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and assess the overall risk using Logistic Regression. 

**Logistic Regression** is a statistical and machine-learning technique used to classify data based on input variables. It estimates a dependent variable using one or more independent variables to predict outcomes.
The dataset for this project, available on **Kaggle**, originates from a cardiovascular study involving Massachusetts residents. It contains **over 4,000 records** and 15 attributes, and the objective is to predict whether a patient is at risk of CHD within the next decade.
